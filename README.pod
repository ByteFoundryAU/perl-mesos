Net::Mesos - perl bindings for Apache Mesos

=head1 Description

This is a collection of perl bindings for Apache Mesos. This requires having the mesos shared library installed, in order to link against(much like python's mesos library).

The Apache Mesos library is multithreaded, which is problematic when dealing with perl. The solution Net::Mesos currently goes with is to create C++ proxy classes, which registers callbacks that send notifications over a pipe, to perl. In the future this may change to sockets, or even to a pure perl implementation of mesos drivers(the latter would also eliminate the need for linking against the mesos shared library). Net::Mesos then handles these notifications, and executes the corresponding perl code, inside of an AnyEvent loop.
